# TIME MANAGER

The revolt rises in the halls of Gotham town hall!


Rumors of strikes and resignations run, and the main union (CGT-U, which stands for City of
Gotham Trade-Union) alerts the mayor and senior officials of the town hall of the urgency of the
situation.

To calm the tensions, the town hall decides to make a state of play of the situation, and why not,
to allow the municipal workers to have access to some days off to recuperate.
For this, it needs to set up a time management application.
